# WIP-HoloBank
this is my third project ive done (the other two are PID so i wont upload them) and this one is the first one i used OOP with, i did use ai for assistance too
also i chose this as my project (cant turn one in through coursera because id have to pay to so im doing a self challenge project utilizing anything i learned) because for one i really like star wars,
but i chose it because i can add so much detail in it and use a heiarchal tree which is what this will turn into and ill add each version of source codes before/after import, 
this did start off semi basic as a "what if i just do say Starkiller and then list his details or something for his bio and say Darth Revan and add his and do characters",
then i thought "I can do far better than that with what ive learned" so i came up with this, it consists of: Characters, Factions, Vehicles, and Cruisers, topping off each of them will be linked with their respecitve era (Starkiller being Empire era of course).
After i finish this ill be moving onto C and learning more and master that and C++ along with OpenCL later and CUDA.


Bundled update incase it doesnt let you read it

These are all the tests leading up to the big "release" as my ai assistant has wrote that it will be, itll be getting put out after i upload this (12/29/25), im still really bad about writing comments since i know how to read the code and i do plan to work on that as i continue because ill need to.
Explanation on files: 
fileLoop.py is the loop process of choices for inside the testing CLI terminal when its opened and holds that set of data and statements.
Full_HB__GUI.py holds the GUI's entire build (or mainloop so everything inside keeps running while its open). 
Holobank_engine.py holds the programs main body which consists of it being told what data to hold and some of the eras belonging to the objects.
Conjoined_HBB.py was a test run to make sure the,
ImportHB.py would work, which that is the files open/close script.
