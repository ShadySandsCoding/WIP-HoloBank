# WIP-HoloBank
this is my third project ive done (the other two are PID so i wont upload them) and this one is the first one i used OOP with, i did use ai for assistance too
also i chose this as my project (cant turn one in through coursera because id have to pay to so im doing a self challenge project utilizing anything i learned) because for one i really like star wars,
but i chose it because i can add so much detail in it and use a heiarchal tree which is what this will turn into and ill add each version of source codes before/after import, 
this did start off semi basic as a "what if i just do say Starkiller and then list his details or something for his bio and say Darth Revan and add his and do characters",
then i thought "I can do far better than that with what ive learned" so i came up with this, it consists of: Characters, Factions, Vehicles, and Cruisers, topping off each of them will be linked with their respecitve era (Starkiller being Empire era of course).
After i finish this ill be moving onto C and learning more and master that and C++ along with OpenCL later and CUDA.
